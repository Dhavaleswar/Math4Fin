## Option Greeks

* The option Greeks measure the sensitivity of the option price to various factors. The most common Greeks are:
    - Delta
    - Gamma
    - Theta
    - Vega
    - Rho

### Delta:
* Measures the rate of change of the option price with respect to the underlying asset price. For call options $0 \leq \Delta \leq 1$, while for put options $-1 \leq \Delta \leq 0$.

### Gamma:
* Measures the rate of change of Delta with respect to changes in underlying asset price. Gamma is particulary important as it affects how delta changes w.r.t. the stock price.

### Theta:
* Measures the rate of change of the option price with respect to time. Theta is typically negative, indicating that the option price decreases as time passes.

### Vega:
* Measures the rate of change of the option price with respect to Volatility in the underlying asset's price. Vega indicates how much option price will change given a 1% change in asset volatility.

### Rho:
* Measures the rate of change of the option price with respect to risk-free rate. For call options, a higher rate typically increases the option value, and while for put option it decreases.
